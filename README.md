Some info about charts 

Clustered column chart - 
             
              When there is data limited there we use a chart .(note)
             
              Clustered columns allow the direct comparison of multiple series, but they become visually complex quickly.
              
              Allow direct comparison of multiple data series per category
              
              Can show change over time
              

Donat chart - 

              always replace a pie chart with donat chart 
              
              in these we can see the region and month wise data with the help of sales and profit .
              
              in that also limited region and month will present .

                these is more suitable then donat chart .
